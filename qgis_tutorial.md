- terminology: terminology in GIS differs from other data-related fields (most notably `feature` has a different meaning.
  - `feature`: spatial object or geographic entity, e.g. a building, a road or a point of interest.
  - `field` or `attribute`: a specific non-spatial property of a feature that can be recorded (a column in an `attribute table`) E.g. number of floors, type of road, ..., so what is typically called a `feature` in data science or machine learning.
  - `record`: a feature and its recorded attributes (a row in an `attribute table`).
  - `feature class`: group of similar features, all with the same type of geometry (point, line, polygon) and the same set of attributes. E.g., all the buildings in an area, or all the roads in a city.
